In NLP, encoder and decoder are two important components, with the transformer layer becoming a popular architecture for both components. FasterTransformer implements a highly optimized transformer layer for both the encoder and decoder for inference. On Volta, Turing and Ampere GPUs, the computing power of Tensor Cores are used automatically when the precision of the data and weights are FP16.

FasterTransformer is built on top of CUDA, cuBLAS, cuBLASLt and C++. We provide at least one API of the following frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch and Triton backend. Users can integrate FasterTransformer into these frameworks directly. For supporting frameworks, we also provide example codes to demonstrate how to use, and show the performance on these frameworks.

FasterTransformer development has transitioned to TensorRT-LLM. All developers are encouraged to leverage TensorRT-LLM to get the latest improvements on LLM Inference. The NVIDIA/FasterTransformer repo will stay up, but will not have further development.
