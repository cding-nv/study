 When it comes to driving motivation, it can vary greatly from person to person. Some common driving motivations include:
1. Independence and Freedom: Many people are motivated to drive because it gives them the freedom to go wherever they want, whenever they want, without relying on public transportation or others for transportation.
2. Convenience: Driving can be more convenient than relying on other modes of transportation, especially when it comes to running errands, commuting to work, or traveling with a lot of luggage or equipment.
3. Exploration and Adventure: For some, driving is a way to explore new places, go on road trips, and experience the thrill of discovering new destinations and scenic routes.
4. Time-saving: Driving can often be faster than other modes of transportation, especially for shorter distances or in areas with limited public transportation options.
5. Personal and Professional Needs: Many people are motivated to drive because it is necessary for their personal or professional needs, such as commuting to work, transporting children to school, or carrying out job-related tasks.
6. Enjoyment and Passion: Some individuals simply enjoy the act of driving itself. They find pleasure in the experience of being behind the wheel, the sense of control, and the connection with the road.
These are just a few examples, and there can be many other personal motivations for driving. It ultimately depends on the individual and their unique circumstances and preferences.

Carthage

Genocide

I'm interested in the history of ships beginning the 16th Century and how they were used to discover new continents.

Cruise = travel by ship 

I have been on a boat to travel to an island. It was a small boat with 10-20 passengers.
I would be interested in taking a cruise when I retire. I will have time to enjoy sailing for several days and enjoying the scenery.

I think it would be very interesting to cruise the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa to Italy, France, and Greece among other places. 
There were many sea battles between the Romans and Egyptians and North Africans.

Carthage is in Tunisia and the technology of the ships used were advanced for the time.
Carthage eventually fell to Rome and many people were killed or were taken a slaves.

Western European countries were poor countries and wanted to develop trade and exploration in general to increase their wealth.

Native people were not killed by Germans.

I think there was a huge gap between civilization. The Europeans regarded the African and South American "indigenous" (native) people as being animals so they didn't feel guilt when killing them

Safari---tour of Africa with hunters designed to kill wild animals for sport.

Is violence a human quality?
As humans evolved they killed to survive. 

I witnessed police shooting into the sky to scare a car thief. I was in San Francisco.
I think guns are dangerous and they worry me.

I believe that guns can equalize people.

There are pros and cons to legalizing guns.
Here the authorities restrict private citizen gun ownership. I haven't seen police officers here with guns.
Police officers carry guns in the US. Some security officers also carry guns.

Officers touch their guns if they think there is potential threat.

This is a very safe country. 

I want to have a family one day.
Having children is expensive now.

I would change my home's location and move to the city center. It would make commuting easier for me. I want to buy an apartment near my company so that I can walk to work daily.

I like going to the office for work because the environment is positive and I have convenient access to meals and coffee at work. It is also easier to focus on my work. I have fewer "distractions" in the office.

Travel wastes time that I could be spending doing other things, like studying English, playing sports, spending time(socializing) in bars with friends, meeting and dating beautiful girls.

Today people are able to meet new people because of the advances in technology, we have access to social media and computers for communication. Travel is convenient and cheap where as in the past there were not many options available for transportation. 

In the past most people were farmers and today it is possible to get jobs in the city.

People tend to be more lonely because they are not meeting in person. They are meeting and communicating online instead of face to face. 
Friendships are not cherished anymore because they are interacting with so many different people daily. 
I also think that people are more focused on making a lot of money rather than developing personal relationships. 
As technology has developed more, people are becoming more like machines. Humans are a "biological" machine

What is the most common "challenge" (difficulty, problem) for people today?
I think people have lost the ability to achieve value in their life.

Philosophical---

Follow your heart, do what you like to do.

"No money, no future"

If you had billions of dollars, what would you do?

I would return to school, attend a famous university and get a PhD in technology research and then write a book. I would travel and live in a variety of locations, experience different cultures. I would travel to the Arctic, Africa, Pacific Islands, Dubai.
Antarctic?
Penquins in the South, Polar Bears in the north.

I would write a book about traveling the world and finding value in life.
I will search for the answer "Why?"
"unwind"=relax

Fickleness


I have been to India  twice on business trips. The first time was to Bangalore, and the second time was to Puna where nvidia all Tegra R&D there.

I know 3 gods.  Ganesh, god of wisdom, hanuman, god of strength, Laxmi, god of wealth. 
What impressed me deeply is that India people saves resources. Whether in the canteen or in the restaurant, there is white cloth provided but no napkins, rarely something one-off / disposable          tableware . Another example is that, I bought mango juice on the street. The seller provided me a glass bottle with the mango juice. I couldn't take it away and had to drink it and return the glass bottle.
When we came back from Puna, we needed to plane transfer in New Delhi. We had time to visit Taj Mahal （white and shine）and Agra fort.

    有一次我驾车在旧金山的街道上, 在一个红灯前面, 因为停止线不清楚,我越过了停止线, 我很不好意思的看着人行横道过往的人, 向他们点头表示歉意, 他们都向我摇头, 并露出鄙视的目光, 这让我有所触动. 在中国则是事不关己高高挂起, 只要不伤害到自己的利益,不会有人主动阻止你干坏事. 我想在旧金山因为每个人心目中都有rules, 而且约定遵守,当发现没有人遵守的时候,他们就会觉得有冒犯,哪怕是跟自己毫无关系. 我在古罗马的故事一书中也看到过类似的情节, 我想这个rule在那时候开始西方就已经慢慢建立起来了. 这个是中西方最大的差别,我觉得. 但在中国不是没有rule, 在中国人心目中的规则是良心, 是面子.
Once I was driving on the streets of San Francisco, in front of a red light, because the stop line was unclear, I crossed the stop line, and I was embarrassed watching the people at the crosswalk, nodding their apologies, they all told me Shaking my head and showing scornful eyes, it touched me. In China, it is nothing to hang high, as long as it does not hurt your own interests, no one will actively stop you from doing bad things. I think in San Francisco because Everyone has rules in their minds, and they agree to abide by them. When they find that no one obeys, they will feel offended, even if it has nothing to do with themselves. I have seen similar in the book of ancient Roman stories Plot, I think the rule has been gradually established in the West since then. This is the biggest difference between China and the West, I think. But in China, there is no rule. The rules in the Chinese mind are conscience and face

     耶稣说他是神的儿子而不说是他生父生母的儿子, 意思就是 父子之间也是平等的, 只要每个人有平等的意识, 他就不会因为不平等而去争取平等了,  不会因为高低贵贱去争取高贵和优越感. 我只想专注于某些自己感兴趣的事情, 而且我相信, 只要专注且感兴趣一定能取得一定成绩. 
Jesus said that he was the son of God and not the son of his biological father and mother, which means that father and son are also equal. As long as everyone has an equal awareness, he will not fight for superiority, Noble and noble to fight for nobleness. 
 I just want to focus on something that interests me, and I believe that as long as you focus and are interested, you will definitely get some results.

You said you have full confidence Intel will be successful, otherwise, you would not have joined Intel. Thank you for guiding us. 
In your opinion, what strategy should Intel adopt to expand the market? From any perspective like ecosystem construction, Inference/training, hardware gpu/DSA, Hardware and software co-design, CCL/Scale, even management and execution and so on. Is there any improvement in Intel inference products compared to tensorrt/tensorrt-llm?
